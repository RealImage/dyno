Encrypt and decrypt DynamoDB primary key attribute values.
You can either use AWS KMS (you don't manage keys, but its expensive)
or a cipher with your own key. AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are supported.

Use it to ecnrypt last evaluated key values from DynamoDB Query responses.
Clients can use these encrypted opaque values to paginate through queries.
